A simple minesweeper game, built with React. Includes several board layouts, with customizable size and mine counts. Also has an option to generate games which are always solvable, and also a solver to automatically play through. Check it out at https://hudson-pace.github.io/minesweeper.

NOTE: Most of the features of this project have been added to (this one)[https://github.com/hudson-pace/shape-editor], which has effectively subsumed this project. No more updates are expected.
